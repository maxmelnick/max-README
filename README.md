# max-README
A crash course on what to expect if I'm your tech lead or engineering manager.

## Purpose of the document

* Help you understand me so we can work together more effectively
* Helps me identify and refine my thoughts and values

## About me

I'm born and raised in the DC area. I grew up in Bethesda, MD and currently live in DC. I studied Systems Engineering and minored in Economics and Engineering Business at UVA.

My passion is building things! I'm a [maker](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) at heart. I enjoy creating analytics capabilities with my strong blend of technical and business skills. The majority of my experience focuses on technology product development, big data/graph analytics, solution architecture, enterprise architecture, and machine learning.

Outside work I enjoy hanging with friends / family, sports / exercise, travel, cooking/eating, reading, listening to podcasts, and learning new things!

A few other tidbits about me:

* My primary [business chemistry](https://businesschemistry.deloitte.com) is driver
* I'm a visual learner. You can explain things to me much more effectively with pictures vs words.

To learn more about me and my experience, see [my website](http://maxmelnick.com/about/).

## My goal

* Develop empowered and driven teams. I want to be able to take off a month and it shouldn't make a difference (seriously).
* Build impactful and sustainable data-driven capabilities

## My role / responsibilities 

I've worn a lot of hats over the years, but the roles I focus on these days to help build analytics capabilities are 1) solution engineer, 2) engineering manager, and 3) mentor / leader. Below are some example dimensions of each.

* _Solution engineer_ (i.e., developing new technical capabilities)
    * Solution architecture design
    * Technology research and evaluation
    * Prototyping and proof-of-concept development
* _Engineering manager_
    * Strategic planning
    * Risk and quality management
    * Incident response and issue resolution
    * Cross-team and cross-project coordination
    * Resource planning and allocation
* _Mentor and leader_ 
    * Provide you feedback
    * Setting clear goals and objectives
    * Enabling team autonomy and growth
    * Sharing organizational context and insights
    * Attracting, retaining, and developing talent
    * Cultivating a culture of passion, innovation, and collaboration

## Principles and values

### Purpose and Clarity
- [Start with why](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002Q6XUE4/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) - understand the purpose behind your work
- Set clear goals and priorities

### Learning and Growth
- Embrace a [growth mindset](https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means)
- Iterate quickly and learn from failures
- Prioritize application over theory

### Communication and Collaboration
- Use visuals to communicate effectively
- Foster open and honest communication
- Respect, trust, and integrity

### Decision Making 
- Data-driven decision making
- Seek quick feedback loops
- Right challenge-to-skill balance

### Execution
- Bias toward action over excessive analysis
- Maximize impact and value creation

## Team environment I strive to cultivate

* Impactful - we get stuff done that has value
* Open - open lines of communication, honesty
* Always learning and improving - learn and fail fast...a lot. Don't be afraid to fail. Be honest when something is a failure.
* Fun

## Availability / work-life balance

TLDR; Very few things are more important than talking to you if you want to talk to me. If you need to talk, let’s talk.

* _Communication:_ I strategically limit how much I check communications to allow time to focus. As such, please do not expect a response from me immediately. If you need to reach me, I respond to communications generally in this order or priority: in-person > call > txt > teams > email
* _Work hours:_
    * I like to start work on the earlier side and leave on the earlier side so I can walk my dog, go to the gym, or hang out with friends. I’ll generally do some light work or technical coding in the evening.
    * I prefer not to have meetings before 9am so I can have some focused time to organize my day.
    * I work a bit on the weekends. This is my choice. I do not expect that you are going to work on the weekend. I might message or email you things, but unless the thing says URGENT, it can always wait until work begins for you on Monday.
    * I try and stay unplugged when on PTO, with the exception of organizing email. Don’t expect a response from me though. If it’s urgent, call me.

## How I can help you

* Provide context and clarity
* Give you feedback (see below)
* Provide another perspective
* Be your cheerleader
* Provide opportunities to grow
* Firefight
* Something else? Please let me know how else I can help.

## How you can help me / basic expectations

### Take Initiative
- Bring forward potential solutions, not just problems
- Seek clarification when expectations are ambiguous
- Communicate proactively if you cannot meet a commitment

### Foster Transparency
- Be open about your workload, stress levels, or conflicts
- Challenge ideas respectfully through healthy debate
- Provide candid feedback if I fall short

## Your development / feedback protocol

* Your career is yours. You know best how you’d like to grow and in what areas. I can provide feedback and an outside perspective.
* I’ll do my best to provide growth and learning opportunities, it’ll be up to you to seize them. Let’s work together on this.
* At the end of the day, it is your career. You set your goals. You set your priorities. Let me know how I can help you achieve them.
* I will sometimes put you in situations where you feel uncomfortable from a skill/experience-fit perspective. I do this on purpose because it helps you learn faster.
* [Three dimensions are required](https://medium.com/@royrapoport/why-wont-you-talk-to-me-f30a01a1994c) for people to continue to give you feedback. Let me know if I don't do well on any of these three dimensions.
    * Safety should be high (no fear of retaliation)
    * Effort should be low (no rebuttals)
    * Benefit should be high (positive results)

## 1-1’s

* There’s a lot of variety in frequency, length and format of one on ones with my 1-1's. From thirty minutes bi-weekly to an hour per week. Coffee, lunch, private meeting room, head out for a walk, let me know what works best.
* Length, frequency, format and content is up to you.
* The best 1:1s I’ve had have focused beyond the moment: Your career development, team strategy and opportunity, the greater firm, etc. Feel free to come with a topic you’d like to discuss. I’d love it if you spent a few minutes beforehand preparing so that we can get the most of our time.

## Other things to know about me

* _[Socratic questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_questioning)._ At times I'll ask you open-ended questions to get your input instead of directing you to do something. Sometimes it will feel awkwark and frustruation. I do it to help you learn.
* _Meetings._ I try to limit the amount of people in meetings to make them more productive and to maximize people’s focused time. If I didn’t invite you to a meeting, I was probably trying to let you focus on your work. It was not anything personal. If you feel you should be in a meeting that you’re not, just ask.

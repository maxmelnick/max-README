## principles and values

* trust, respect, honesty, and integrity
* start with why. always understand why you’re doing something. If you’re not sure, ask. 
* pictures over words
* managing to flow states (i.e.,being in the zone)
    * clear goals
    * quick feedback loops
    * right challenge:skill ratio
* iterate and learn fast. maximize information gain. what are the biggest risks and what actions will help you learn the most?
* application over theory
* show me the data. data driven decision making over instinct
* bias towards action. Analysis and debate are often valuable, but I believe starting is the best way to learn and make progress.
* Self reflection. Self reflection is an important part of growth. You’ll miss opportunities without it.
* growth mindset

## availability / work-life balance

TLDR; Very few things are more important than talking to you if you want to talk to me. If you need to talk, let’s talk.

* communication: I strategically limit how much I check communications to allow time to focus. As such, please do not expect a response from me immediately. If you need to reach me, I respond to communications generally in this order or priority: in-person > call > txt > slack > skype > email
* work hours. 
    * I like to get in on the earlier side (7:30-8am) and leave on the earlier side (4-4:30pm) so I can go to the gym or hang out with friends. I’ll generally do some light work or technical coding in the evening. 
    * I prefer not to have meetings before 9am so I can have some focused time.
    * I work a bit on the weekends. This is my choice. I do not expect that you are going to work on the weekend. I might Slack you things, but unless the thing says URGENT, it can always wait until work begins for you on Monday.
    * I try and stay unplugged when on PTO, with the exception of organizing email. Don’t expect a response from me though. If it’s urgent, call me.

## how I can help you

* Provide context and clarity
* Provide another perspective
* Be your cheerleader
* Firefight
* Other. Please let me know how else I can help.

## how you can help me / basic expectations

* Do amazing work. This is the expectation. Let me know if there is something preventing you from accomplishing this.
* Come with solutions. Don’t just come with problems. come with possible solutions and a perspective on which you recommend and why.
* When I ask you to do something that feels poorly defined you should ask me for both clarification and a call on importance. I might still be brainstorming. These questions can save everyone a lot of time.
* communicate how you’re feeling. I’d rather know you’re stressed or conflicted and help you work through it than 
* Let me know if you can’t do something. One of my main responsibilities is ensuring that you’re set up for success. Occasionally things slip through the cracks and I won’t know I’m letting you down.
* Disagree with me. The best solutions comes from a healthy level of debate. We need to be able to separate our ideas from our egos . I’ll challenge your ideas with the goal of coming to the best possible solution, I hope you’ll challenge mine.
* Tell me when I screw up. This is very important. I screw up and sometimes don’t notice. I need to know or I’ll likely do it again.

## your development / feedback protocol

* Your career is yours. You know best how you’d like to grow and in what areas. I can provide feedback and an outside perspective.
* I’ll do my best to provide growth and learning opportunities, it’ll be up to you to seize them. Let’s work together on this.
* At the end of the day, it is your career. You set your goals. You set your priorities. Let me know how I can help you achieve them.
* I will sometimes put you in situations where you feel uncomfortable from a skill/experience-fit perspective. I do this on purpose because I think it helps you learn the fastest. 
* Three dimensions are required for people to continue to give you feedback:
    * Safety should be high (no fear of retaliation)
    * Effort should be low (no rebuttals)
    * Benefit should be high (positive results)
* Let me know if I don't do well on any of these three dimensions

## 1-1’s

* There’s a lot of variety in frequency, length and format of one on ones with my direct reports. From thirty minutes bi-weekly to an hour per week. Coffee, lunch, private meeting room, head out for a walk, let me know what works best.
* Length, frequency, format and content is up to you. We’ll start with 30 minutes bi-weekly and then adjust from there.
* The best 1:1s I’ve had have focused beyond the moment: Your career development, team strategy and opportunity, the greater Deloitte, etc. Feel free to come with a topic you’d like to discuss. I’d love it if you spent a few minutes beforehand preparing so that we can get the most of our time.

## other things to know about me

* socratic questions
* pomodoro
* meetings. I try to limit the amount of people in meetings to make them more productive and to maximize people’s focused time. If I didn’t invite you to a meeting, I was probably trying to let you focus on your work. It was not anything personal. If you feel you should be in a meeting that you’re not, just ask.

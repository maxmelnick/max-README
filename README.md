# max-README
A crash course on what to expect if I'm your tech lead

## Purpose of the document

* Help you understand me so we can work together more effectively
* Helps me identify and refine my thoughts and values

## About me

I'm born and raised in the DC area. I grew up in Bethesda, MD and currently live in DC. I studied Systems Engineering and minored in Economics and Engineering Business at UVA.

My passion is building things and I'm a [maker](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) at heart. I enjoy creating analytics capabilities with my strong blend of technical and business skills. The majority of my experience focuses on technology product development, big data/graph analytics, solution architecture, enterprise architecture, and machine learning.

Outside work I enjoy hanging with friends / family, sports / exercise, travel, cooking/eating, reading, listening to podcasts, and learning new things!

A few other tidbits about me:

* My primary [business chemistry](https://businesschemistry.deloitte.com) is driver
* I'm a visual learner. You can explain things to me much more effectively with pictures vs words.

To learn more about me and my experience, see [my website](http://maxmelnick.com/about/).

## My goal

* Develop empowered and driven teams. I want to be able to take off a month and it shouldn't make a difference (seriously).
* Build impactful and sustainable data-driven capabilities

## My role / responsibilities 

I've worn a lot of hats over the years, but the roles I focus on these days to help build analytics capabilities are 1) solution engineer, 2) engineering manager, and 3) mentor / leader. Below are some example dimensions of each.

* _Solution engineer_ (i.e., developing new analytics capabilities)
    * Core strategic planning and business model design
    * Solution architecture
    * Tech sensing
    * Writing prototype code
* _Engineering manager_ (ops + optimizing existing capabilities)
    * Help manage risk and quality
    * Debug critical issues
    * Manage cross-product collaboration
    * Manage cross project priorities and ensure we have the right skills on each
* _Mentor and leader_ (i.e., enabler of great work).
    * Provide you feedback
    * Set context and clarity of goals/objectives
    * Set up teams for success and autonomy
    * Collect and share context from across the broader organization
    * Attract, retain and grow high performing individuals and teams
    * Foster a culture of passion, innovation and collaboration leading to a track record for building high quality capabilities

## Principles and values

* Trust, respect, honesty, and integrity
* [Start with why](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002Q6XUE4/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). Always understand why you’re doing something. If you’re not sure, ask.
* Pictures and visuals communicate more effectively than words
* Manage to flow states (i.e., being in "the zone"). Three main criteria for being in a flow state are...
    * Clear goals
    * Quick feedback loops
    * Right challenge:skill ratio
* Iterate and learn fast. Figure out how to maximize "information gain." What are the biggest risks and what actions will help you learn the most?
* Priority. Priority. Priority. If priorities are not clear, we need to talk.
* Application over theory
* Show me the data. Data driven-decision making over instinct.
* Bias towards action. Analysis and debate are often valuable, but I believe simply starting is the best way to learn and make progress.
* Self reflection. It's an important part of growth. You’ll miss opportunities without it.
* [Growth mindset](https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means)

## Availability / work-life balance

TLDR; Very few things are more important than talking to you if you want to talk to me. If you need to talk, let’s talk.

* _Communication:_ I strategically limit how much I check communications to allow time to focus. As such, please do not expect a response from me immediately. If you need to reach me, I respond to communications generally in this order or priority: in-person > call > txt > slack > skype > email
* _Work hours:_
    * I like to start work on the earlier side (7:30-8am) and leave on the earlier side (4-4:30pm) so I can go to the gym or hang out with friends. I’ll generally do some light work or technical coding in the evening.
    * I prefer not to have meetings before 9am so I can have some focused time to organize my day.
    * I work a bit on the weekends. This is my choice. I do not expect that you are going to work on the weekend. I might Slack or email you things, but unless the thing says URGENT, it can always wait until work begins for you on Monday.
    * I try and stay unplugged when on PTO, with the exception of organizing email. Don’t expect a response from me though. If it’s urgent, call me.

## How I can help you

* Provide context and clarity
* Provide another perspective
* Be your cheerleader
* Firefight
* Something else? Please let me know how else I can help.

## How you can help me / basic expectations

* *Do amazing work.* This is the expectation. Let me know if there is something preventing you from accomplishing this.
* *Come with solutions.* Don’t just come with problems. Think through some possible solutions and a perspective on which you recommend and why.
* *Ask for clarification.* When I ask you to do something that feels poorly defined you should ask me for both clarification and a call on importance. I might still be brainstorming. These questions can save everyone a lot of time.
* *Communicate how you’re feeling.* I’d rather know you’re stressed or conflicted and help you work through it than make you battle with it internally.
* *Let me know if you can’t do something.* One of my main responsibilities is ensuring that you’re set up for success. Occasionally things slip through the cracks and I won’t know I’m letting you down.
* *Disagree with me.* The best solutions come from a healthy level of debate. I’ll challenge your ideas with the goal of coming to the best possible solution, I hope you’ll challenge mine.
* *Tell me when I screw up.* This is very important. I screw up and sometimes don’t notice. I need to know or I’ll likely do it again.

## Your development / feedback protocol

* Your career is yours. You know best how you’d like to grow and in what areas. I can provide feedback and an outside perspective.
* I’ll do my best to provide growth and learning opportunities, it’ll be up to you to seize them. Let’s work together on this.
* At the end of the day, it is your career. You set your goals. You set your priorities. Let me know how I can help you achieve them.
* I will sometimes put you in situations where you feel uncomfortable from a skill/experience-fit perspective. I do this on purpose because it helps you learn faster.
* [Three dimensions are required](https://medium.com/@royrapoport/why-wont-you-talk-to-me-f30a01a1994c) for people to continue to give you feedback. Let me know if I don't do well on any of these three dimensions.
    * Safety should be high (no fear of retaliation)
    * Effort should be low (no rebuttals)
    * Benefit should be high (positive results)

## 1-1’s

* There’s a lot of variety in frequency, length and format of one on ones with my 1-1's. From thirty minutes bi-weekly to an hour per week. Coffee, lunch, private meeting room, head out for a walk, let me know what works best.
* Length, frequency, format and content is up to you.
* The best 1:1s I’ve had have focused beyond the moment: Your career development, team strategy and opportunity, the greater firm, etc. Feel free to come with a topic you’d like to discuss. I’d love it if you spent a few minutes beforehand preparing so that we can get the most of our time.

## Other things to know about me

* _[Socratic questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_questioning)._ At times I'll ask you open-ended questions to get your input instead of directing you to do something. Sometimes it will feel awkwark and frustruation. I do it to help you learn.
* _Pomodoro._ I like to use the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) for time management to help me focus. I generally try to focus on one thing for ~25 mins and then take ~5 min break, with a longer ~15 min break after every 4 cycles. You'll probably see me do some light stretching, hit some golf putts, or do something totally different during those breaks.
* _Meetings._ I try to limit the amount of people in meetings to make them more productive and to maximize people’s focused time. If I didn’t invite you to a meeting, I was probably trying to let you focus on your work. It was not anything personal. If you feel you should be in a meeting that you’re not, just ask.
